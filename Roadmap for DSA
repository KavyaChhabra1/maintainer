### **Phase 5: Problem Solving and Practice**

1. **Solve Problems on Platforms**:
   - **Easy**: Start with basic problems on platforms like **LeetCode**, **Codeforces**, **HackerRank**, and **GeeksforGeeks**.
   - **Moderate**: Focus on optimization and writing clean, efficient code.
   - **Hard**: Try complex algorithmic challenges (Dynamic Programming, Graphs, etc.).

2. **Contest Practice**:
   - Participate in coding competitions on **Codeforces**, **CodeChef**, or **AtCoder**.
   - Analyze solutions after contests to understand new approaches.

### **Phase 6: Advanced Topics (Optional)**

1. **Segment Trees/Fenwick Trees**:
   - Useful in range query problems.
   - Applications: Range sum query, range minimum/maximum query.

2. **Disjoint Set Union (DSU)/Union-Find**:
   - Solve problems involving dynamic connectivity.
   - Applications: Kruskal’s Algorithm, connected components.

3. **String Algorithms**:
   - **KMP (Knuth-Morris-Pratt)** for pattern matching.
   - **Rabin-Karp** and **Z-algorithm** for advanced string manipulations.

### **Phase 7: Mock Interviews and Real-World Problems**

1. **Simulate Interviews**:
   - Use mock interview platforms like **Pramp** or **InterviewBit**.
   - Focus on explaining your approach clearly and optimizing solutions in real-time.

2. **Real-World Problems**:
   - Explore system design and real-world applications of DSA.
   - Dive into problems that integrate algorithms with large-scale systems.

---

### **Tips for Success**

- **Consistency**: Solve problems regularly, increasing difficulty over time.
- **Understand, Don’t Memorize**: Focus on understanding the logic rather than memorizing solutions.
- **Track Progress**: Use spreadsheets or tools like **LeetCode** to track which types of problems you’ve solved.
- **Revise Regularly**: Revisit data structures and algorithms you’ve learned to ensure retention.

This roadmap will guide you from beginner to advanced, helping you build a strong foundation in DSA while continuously improving through problem-solving.
